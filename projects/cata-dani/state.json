Then Colombia to visit her family. Food is a huge daily struggle — bad quality in the area, never know what to eat. Jan 31 evening: wine mode gaming chat. Cata feels bored after Elden Ring, everything feels like brain rot. Discussed many game recommendations. Cata values deep, systems-driven games like Kenshi - not 'brain rot' mainstream stuff. Conversation ended naturally late night (~23:30 their time). Feb 1: Sunday, no new activity yet.",
