### 🔗 THE CONNECTION:

Unlike previous Germany water videos (native Germans complaining), this is the INTERNATIONAL EXPAT perspective — people moving TO Germany and experiencing sudden hair crisis. English-speaking audience. Higher emotional stakes (they had good hair before). Comments show: (1) Hard water awareness is rising, (2) Water filters being recommended organically, (3) Friends tagging friends to share solutions.
