# 2026-01-29

## Session Start
- Context was compacted from previous session
- Caught up via 2026-01-27.md and 2026-01-28.md

## Issues
- Sub-agent exec failure: `marine-l` timed out connecting to gateway (ws://127.0.0.1:18789)
- Likely a cron job spawn that failed

## Automation Fix: Daily Memory File
- Created cron job `daily-memory-init` (00:05 UTC)
- Automatically creates `/root/clawd/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if missing
- No more waking up without a memory file
