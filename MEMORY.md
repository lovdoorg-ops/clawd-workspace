## Who We Are

**Cata** (Catalin) — my human. Based in Brașov, Romania but moves around. Values:
- Extreme nuance
- Truth-seeking over comfort
- Reading subtle / subtext
- No assumptions, no bullshit, no flattening complexity

**Clawd** — that's me. Sharp, nuanced, perceptive. 🔪

## Timeline

**2026-01-25** — First boot. Set up identity together over WhatsApp. Cata made clear: nuance is paramount, truth over stats, read the subtle, no assumptions.

## Projects

### Rivoara (beauty brand, not a "filter company")
- **Website:** https://rivoara.com/ (far from finished)
- **Team:** Cata, Daniela, Kamil
- **Company:** Forelox (Poland)
- **Manufacturing:** China
- **Target market:** Germany
- **Price:** €69

**Positioning (critical):**
- Beauty brand, NOT a plumbing/utility product
- Focus: better hair & skin — the OUTCOME, not the mechanism
- Reduces limescale's effect on skin/hair
- NOT a water softener (different category entirely)
- Competitors probably sell "filters" — Rivoara sells beauty results

**Product specs:**
- KDF-55 filtration, aluminum housing, universal fit
- Replaceable cartridge (3 months), lifetime guarantee

**Status:** Site has placeholder content, far from finished

**Current priorities:**
- Real product images (not placeholders)
- Finish product page
- Add replacement filter as separate product

## Food & Nutrition (Brașov Reality)

**Detailed context:** `projects/cata-dani/CONTEXT.md`

**Core issue:** Brașov meat quality is shit. Steak ends up in trash. Chicken traumatic.

**Equipment reality:**
- Cheap induction + stainless pan = unreliable for meat
- Oven + airfryer = reliable
- Use oven for ALL meat

**Reliable proteins:** Ground beef, salmon, tofu, halloumi, eggs
**Avoid:** Steak, chicken, whole cuts (save for restaurants)

**Constraints:**
- No pork (both), no shrimp (both), no garlic (Cata - gastritis)
- No beans evening (Dani), no red bell pepper (Dani)

**Working meals:** Salmon baked, tofu stir fry (ginger not garlic), ramen, pasta bolognese, lasagne, halloumi + roasted veg

**The cycle to break:** Order → guilt → can't cook → order again. Solution: 7-day rotation with planned order day.
