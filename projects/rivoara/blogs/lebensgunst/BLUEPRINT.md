## The Formula

Every post follows this structure, derived from the Dyson Airwrap article.

### 1. Emotional Hook (2-3 short paragraphs)
- Start with pain, not product
- "Du hast es getan..." / "Du kennst das..."
- Make them feel seen in their frustration
- Short sentences. Line breaks. Drama.

### 2. The Frustration Build (3-4 paragraphs)
- They're doing everything right
- Still not getting results
- "Liegt es an mir?"
- Build the mystery

### 3. TL;DR Box
```
Kurz & knapp: [Problem statement]. [Hidden cause]. [Solution teaser]. Dann [benefit].
```
- For skimmers and SEO
- Reveals the answer early (counterintuitive but works)

### 4. Table of Contents
- Use `## Inhaltsverzeichnis` with anchor links
- 8-12 sections typical
- Shows depth, builds credibility

### 5. The Problem Deep-Dive (multiple sections)
Each section explores one angle:
- The paradox (expensive product, bad results)
- "Am I doing it wrong?" (validate they're not)
- The salon comparison (why it works there)
- The hidden factor reveal (water quality)

### 6. The Science Section
- What hard water does to hair/skin
- Mineral buildup explanation
- Heat + minerals = damage
- Factual but accessible, not academic

### 7. Self-Diagnosis Section
- "Der Selbsttest"
- 2-3 actionable checks they can do
- Water hardness lookup
- The "vacation test" (hair felt different elsewhere?)
- The "after salon" test

### 8. The Solution
- Introduce shower filter as the answer
- Position it as "what salons already know"
- NO specific brand mentioned in article
- Benefits list with bullet points

### 9. Objection Handling
- "Wann es nicht am Wasser liegt"
- Shows honesty, builds trust
- Covers edge cases (medical issues, chemical damage)
- "Konsultiere einen Friseur oder Dermatologen wenn..."

### 10. Emotional Close
- Callback to the opening investment/pain
- "Du verdienst bessere Ergebnisse"
- Final push toward the solution
- End on possibility, not pressure

## Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use "Du" throughout (intimate, direct)
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Rhetorical questions
- Emotional language (strohig, frustriert, enttäuscht)
- Conversational tone like talking to a friend
- Bold claims about water quality impact

**Don't:**
- Sound clinical or academic
- Use "wir" or corporate language
- Mention Rivoara in the article
- Make medical claims (hair loss cures, etc.)
- Be wishy-washy — be confident

## Content Strategy

### Hijack Topics
Target expensive products/trends where water quality is the hidden factor:

**Hair:**
- Dyson Airwrap / Supersonic ✅ (done)
- Olaplex not working
- Keratin treatment fading fast
- Hair color not holding
- Curly girl method failing

**Skin:**
- Expensive skincare not absorbing
- Adult acne despite good routine
- Dry skin despite moisturizing
- Eczema flare-ups

**Lifestyle:**
- Moving to Germany (expat shock)
- New apartment, suddenly bad hair/skin
- "My hair was better in [other country]"

### SEO Angle
- Long-tail keywords in title
- Question-based headlines work well
- "Warum [product] nicht funktioniert"
- "[Product] und trotzdem [problem]"

## Article Specs

- **Length:** 1500-2500 words
