# Rivoara Cron Job Drafts

Ideas for future cron jobs or content approaches. Not active yet.

## Format Hunter

**Concept:** Dedicated job to find viral FORMAT structures (not topics) that could carry Rivoara's message.

**Example format idea:**
```
"This is NOT skincare" → products with chemicals, 10-step routines, expensive serums
"This IS skincare" → sun, shower filter, sleep
```

Contrarian. Positions Rivoara alongside fundamentals, not product clutter.

**Other formats to watch:**
- Contrast / "vs" formats
- Before/after
- "No one talks about this"
- Myth-busting
- "The real reason..."
- Minimalist / anti-consumerist angles

**Status:** Draft. May merge into main trends job or run separately.

## Notes

- Keep formats separate from trend hunting?
- Or add light "notice formats" line to existing job?
- TBD based on what current job discovers
