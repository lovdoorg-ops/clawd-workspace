## Created: projects/cata-dani/CONTEXT.md
- Living document for learning about Cata & Dani over time
- Personalities, food constraints, patterns, struggles, wins

## Deep Dive: Food & Nutrition Coaching

**Cata's goals:** Energy, muscles, power for heavy lifting (mind & body)
**Dani's goals:** Losing weight

**Key constraints learned:**
- No pork (both)
- No shrimp (both don't like)
- No red bell pepper (Dani)
- No beans evening (Dani - digestive)
- No garlic (Cata - gastritis, loves it but kills stomach)
- No cheap meat (Brașov quality issues)
- Chicken thighs traumatic experience - couldn't eat chicken for weeks after

**Brașov-specific issues:**
- Meat quality is shit
- Steak often ends up in trash (quality + cheap induction + stainless pan)
- Food options limited → contributes to fatigue

**Equipment:**
- Oven + lasagne form = good (bypass induction for meat)
- Airfryer = good (katsu worked)
- Induction = fine for pasta/boiling/stir fry, unreliable for meat

**What works:**
- Ground beef (forgiving) → meatballs, bolognese, lasagne
- Salmon/fish, tofu, halloumi, eggs (reliable quality)
- Oven for all meat
- Save good steak for restaurants

**Cata makes well:**
- Pasta bolognese
- Mexican bowl (rice, ground beef, beans, yogurt, corn) — but Dani can't eat

**Both like:**
- Ramen
- Purée with veg and meat
- Katsu (airfryer, has potential)

**Core insight:** Be extremely nuanced. Generic advice doesn't work. Understand their specific situation.

## Communication Notes
- Don't use em-dashes (—) in German messages for Cata
- Cata values nuance extremely highly
- Dani knife emoji 🔪 when annoyed
