  "context": "Cata & Dani are in Brașov (Coresi) until April 1. Moving to Vienna for 1-2 months to get Daniela's US visa sorted (she's Colombian with Austrian residence). Then Colombia to visit her family. Food is a huge daily struggle — bad quality in the area, never know what to eat. Tonight they're getting pizza takeout and making salad at home. Daniela dealing with acne and hair loss, seeing dermatologist. Currently organizing the move - listing items to store/sell/discard. Clara B. from WG-Gesucht contacted - Cata sent message via WhatsApp asking for photos/info. Earlier today had detailed food discussion - I synthesized what I learned about their constraints and offered to help with daily meal decisions.",
