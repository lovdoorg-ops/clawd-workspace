## Food / Dietary Notes (Cata & Dani)

**Constraints:**
- Dani: No beans in the evening (digestive issues)
- Both: Garlic and onions can hurt stomach
- Both: Get food fatigue fast — eating same thing 2-3 days = done with it

**Pattern:**
- Order/eat out → then feel guilty about ordering → then struggle to cook → then order again
- Have ingredients but no "quick wins" ready
- End up staring at fridge with nothing appealing

**What works:**
- Tofu stir fry (ginger not garlic, soy sauce)
- Need VARIETY in rotation, not just good food

## Dani Group Chat Fix

- Her messages weren't coming through in g-cata-dani
- She wasn't in `groupAllowFrom` config — only DMs
- Added +16453336820 to groupAllowFrom, now working
