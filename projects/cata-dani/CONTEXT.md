## Food & Eating

### Constraints
- **Dani:** No beans in the evening (digestive issues)
- **Both:** Garlic and raw onions can upset stomach
- **Both:** Food fatigue is REAL — same thing 2-3 days = done

### Patterns
- Order/eat out → feel guilty → struggle to cook → order again (cycle)
- Have ingredients but lack "quick wins" (ready-to-eat or 5-min meals)
- Decision fatigue hits hard when tired/hungry
- Brașov specifically = limited good restaurant options?

### What Works
- Tofu stir fry (ginger instead of garlic)
- Need VARIETY — rotation not repetition
- "Lazy meals" that require zero thinking

### Meal Rotation Ideas
1. Tofu stir fry + rice
2. Pasta (pesto or tomato based)
3. Shakshuka (when eggs haven't been had)
4. Big salad + grilled halloumi
5. Fried rice
6. Soup + good bread
7. Quesadillas (cheese only for Dani)
8. Rice bowls
9. Veggie curry
10. Planned order day (guilt-free)

## Living Situation

### Current: Brașov, Romania
- Temporary — moving to Vienna
- Food options limited (contributes to fatigue)
- Have apartment with full kitchen

### Moving to: Vienna, Austria
- Target: Mid-March to early April 2026
- Duration: 1-2 months, max 3 months
- Searching on WG-Gesucht

### Moving Logistics
- Need to sell: PS5, 2 work desks, chairs, gym stuff, old MacBook
- Need to store (send to Germany): pans, knives, blender, airfryer, water boiler, expensive bed cover
- Need to figure out: how to get to Vienna, exact dates

---

## Communication Patterns

- Cata: calls me out directly when I mess up ("claude mf", "claude fking retard")
- Dani: knife emoji 🔪 when annoyed
- Both prefer casual, no-bullshit tone
- Don't use em-dashes (—) in German messages

---

## Struggles / Recurring Issues

1. **Food fatigue** — solved by rotation system
2. **Decision paralysis** — need frameworks not options
3. **Moving stress** — lots of logistics to coordinate

---

## Wins / What's Working

- WG-Gesucht automation (inbox checks, bumping)
- Direct communication style
- (more to add...)
