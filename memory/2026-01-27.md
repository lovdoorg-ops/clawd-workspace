# 2026-01-27

## Session Start
- Context was compacted, caught up via 2026-01-26.md
- Modified files from truncated session: nginx noVNC config, TOOLS.md

## Browser Accounts Added
Cata logged in to VNC browser with new accounts:
- **Google:** lovdo.org@gmail.com
- **X/Twitter:** lovdo.org@gmail.com
- **TikTok:** @lovdo.org (fresh account, 1 follower, region: Germany)
- **WG-Gesucht:** cata.waack@gmail.com (was already logged in)

## WG-Gesucht Check (21:25 UTC)
- Checked inbox via puppeteer connecting to VNC Chrome (port 9222)
- **NEW lead: Frau Yvette (55)** — offering apartment at Anzengrubergasse 4/4, **1050 Wien**
- Other conversations ongoing (Anna S., Petra with 1180 Wien offer, Alex)
- **Listing bumped** successfully (updated to 27.01.2026)
- Sent WhatsApp update to g-cata-dani group

## GitHub Setup (22:00 UTC)
Cata created a GitHub account for me:
- **Account:** lovdoorg-ops
- **Repo:** github.com/lovdoorg-ops/clawd-workspace
- Added SSH key (clawd@clawdbot) via browser automation
- Pushed workspace code
- Invited C4T4 (Catalin Waack) as collaborator

## Technical Notes
- Headless browser (clawd profile) is separate from VNC browser
- VNC Chrome runs on port 9222 with CDP enabled
- Use puppeteer-core to connect: `browserURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:9222'`
- Installed puppeteer-core globally: `/usr/lib/node_modules/puppeteer-core`

## Late Session (23:06 UTC)
- Gateway restarted, WhatsApp reconnected
- **Cata reminded: Two critical habits**
  1. Memory must work — always read/update memory files
  2. Commit after changes — git commit when workspace changes
- Committed stray file: `projects/rivoara/trends-history.json`

## Deep Keyword Research Session (23:30 UTC)
Cata asked for deeper trend research with comments/keywords.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Cheap filters don't work** — users on gutefrage complain they bought filters and saw no improvement. HUGE positioning opportunity for Rivoara.

2. **Pain language discovered:**
   - "strohig" / "Strohspitzen" (straw-like)
   - "glanzlos" (dull)
   - "Unreinheiten" (skin blemishes)
   - "Kopfhaut juckt" (itchy scalp)

3. **Trigger moment:** Moving to a new city — people discover problem after relocating

4. **Berlin is #1 hardest water city in Germany** (17.8-23.9 °dH)
   - Real user story: moved from Baden-Württemberg to Berlin → severe hair loss
   - Person now washes hair with BOTTLED WATER as workaround

5. **Amazon competitors:** €16-25 range (Philips, AquaHomeGroup, AGUALEVE)
   - Rivoara at €69 = 3-4x premium
   - Negative reviews on cheap filters: "doesn't filter anything"

6. **YouTube demand:** Brad Mondo video "Ruiniert hartes Wasser Ihr Haar?" = 397K views

**Sent to g-cata-dani group:** Key insights summary

**Saved to:** `projects/rivoara/keyword-research.md` (comprehensive doc)
