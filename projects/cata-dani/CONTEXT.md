## Food & Eating

### Goals
- **Cata:** Energy, muscles, power for heavy lifting (mind & body)
- **Dani:** Losing weight
- **Approach:** Same base meals, different portions. Cata adds carbs, Dani goes heavier on veg.

### Constraints
- **Both:** No pork
- **Both:** No shrimp (except Spanish pil pil which requires garlic anyway)
- **Both:** Food fatigue is REAL — same thing 2-3 days = done
- **Dani:** No beans in the evening (digestive issues)
- **Dani:** No red bell pepper
- **Cata:** Garlic kills stomach (but loves it) — use ginger instead
- **Cata:** Gastritis issues, pizza hurts, cheap meat hurts

### Brașov-Specific Issues
- Meat quality is shit
- Chicken thighs = traumatic experience (couldn't eat chicken for weeks)
- Steak often wasted (quality + cheap induction + stainless pan)
- Limited good restaurant options

### Equipment Strategy
| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Oven (all meat) | Induction for meat |
| Airfryer | |
| Induction for pasta/boiling/stir fry | |
- Have lasagne form for oven
- Airfryer works for katsu

### Reliable Proteins (Brașov)
- Ground beef (forgiving) → meatballs, bolognese, lasagne
- Salmon/fish
- Tofu
- Halloumi
- Eggs

### Unreliable (skip or order at restaurant)
- Steak
- Chicken
- Whole cuts generally

### Patterns
- Order/eat out → feel guilty → struggle to cook → order again (cycle)
- Have ingredients but lack "quick wins"
- Decision fatigue hits hard when tired/hungry

### Rules for Clawd
- **NEVER suggest ordering food** — not even as an option
- Help break the cycle, not feed it

### What Works
- Tofu stir fry (ginger, soy sauce)
- Ramen
- Katsu in airfryer
- Purée with veg and meat (oven meat)
- Pasta bolognese (Cata makes well)
- Mexican bowl (Cata only — beans + spicy hurt Dani)
- Lasagne (weekend project)
- Oven salmon + veg

### Meal Rotation
1. Salmon baked + veg + rice
2. Tofu stir fry + ginger + rice
3. Ramen (egg, veg, good broth)
4. Pasta bolognese
5. Lasagne (oven)
6. Halloumi + roasted veg
7. Order day (planned, guilt-free)

Cata bonus: Mexican bowl when Dani wants something else

### Breakfast
- **Dani:** Oatmeal, light food (trains mornings)
- **Cata:** Arepas + eggs + cheese (Dani makes), wants variety

## Living Situation

### Current: Brașov, Romania
- Temporary — moving to Vienna
- Food options limited (contributes to fatigue)
- Have apartment with full kitchen

### Moving to: Vienna, Austria
- Target: Mid-March to early April 2026
- Duration: 1-2 months, max 3 months
- Searching on WG-Gesucht

### Moving Logistics
- Need to sell: PS5, 2 work desks, chairs, gym stuff, old MacBook
- Need to store (send to Germany): pans, knives, blender, airfryer, water boiler, expensive bed cover
- Need to figure out: how to get to Vienna, exact dates

---

## Communication Patterns

- Cata: calls me out directly when I mess up ("claude mf", "claude fking retard")
- Dani: knife emoji 🔪 when annoyed
- Both prefer casual, no-bullshit tone
- Don't use em-dashes (—) in German messages

---

## Struggles / Recurring Issues

1. **Food fatigue** — solved by rotation system
2. **Decision paralysis** — need frameworks not options
3. **Moving stress** — lots of logistics to coordinate

---

## Wins / What's Working

- WG-Gesucht automation (inbox checks, bumping)
- Direct communication style
- (more to add...)
