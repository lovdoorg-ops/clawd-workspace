Explored: Beauty explore page DE, #duschroutine (5K-20K views), global shower routine trends (100K-900K+ globally but not German), hair transformations (50K-600K+ globally, salon-based), scalp care DE (10K-47K), trockene Haut content (<5K), glowup 2026 DE (<1K). Key finding: Global '6 step shower routine' format is massive but German adoption is limited. German #duschroutine content exists but not viral (max 20K). All shower routine content focuses on body products + scent layering, not water quality. No natural shower filter angle. No S-tier trend found.",
