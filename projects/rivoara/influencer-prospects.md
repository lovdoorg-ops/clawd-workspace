## Outreach Template (Draft)

> Hey [name]! 👋
> 
> Love your content — especially [specific video/style]. We're launching Rivoara, a premium shower filter that helps with hair and skin health (removes chlorine, limescale, etc).
> 
> Would you be interested in testing one? We'd send it for free — just looking for honest feedback/content if you like it. No pressure, no payment strings attached.
> 
> Let me know! 💧

## Notes
- **Focus on nano/micro creators (500-5k ideal)** — more likely to accept free product, won't ask for payment
- Bigger accounts (5k+) often expect money — skip unless exceptional fit
- Look for creators who already talk about water quality, hair damage, skin issues
- Quality of content > follower count
- German market priority, but DACH region works too
