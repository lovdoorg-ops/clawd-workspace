## Rivoara Project Work

### Test Landing Pages PR
- Created PR #3 in `forelox-dev/rivoara-shopify` with test landing pages for audience segmentation
- Pages: `/test/color-treated`, `/test/curly-hair`, `/test/acne`, `/test/men`, `/test/athletes`, `/test/anti-aging`
- Strategy: Go deep into specific niches instead of broad like Hello Klean
- All pages have `noindex/nofollow`, German copy

### Design Learnings (IMPORTANT)
- First design attempt was "Editorial Noir" - dark, moody. **WRONG DIRECTION**
- Cata said it looks "strange af" - doesn't match Rivoara brand
- **Rivoara actual brand:**
  - Light/white backgrounds
  - Yellow (#FFE453) accent color
  - Clean, minimal aesthetic
  - Product photography focus
  - Sans-serif typography

### Design Guidelines Established
- Created `CLAUDE.md` in rivoara-shopify repo with guidelines
- **Always use frontend-design plugin** when making UI changes on the Shopify Hydrogen site
- Design should blend:
  1. Hello Klean style (clean, soft, beauty-focused)
  2. Premium/bold (confident, not overly pretty)
  3. Match existing Rivoara brand
- **Screenshot workflow:** Always preview changes, compare with main site before committing
- Use "nano banana" for image generation (need to clarify what this is exactly)

### Claude CLI Plugin
- Installed `frontend-design` plugin via `claude plugin install frontend-design`
- Use `/plugins` in Claude CLI to manage
- The plugin adds design guidelines to avoid generic AI aesthetics

### Competitor Analysis: Hello Klean
- VC-funded, broad marketing approach
- €90 shower head, €39.60/3mo refills with subscription
- 60k subscribers claimed
- Positioning: generic "beauty" - softer hair, smoother skin
- **Gap:** They're shallow everywhere. Rivoara can go deep into specific niches

### Audience Segments Identified
1. Color-treated hair (salon investment protection)
2. Curly hair (Curly Girl Method community)
3. Acne-prone skin
4. Men (no beauty language)
5. Athletes/gym (2x daily showers)
6. Anti-aging (skin barrier protection)

### Tech Stack Reminder
- Rivoara: Shopify Hydrogen, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- Deployed via Oxygen (auto-deploys on push)
- Repo: `forelox-dev/rivoara-shopify`
- Production: rivoara.com
- Preview: myshopify.dev URLs (branch-specific)

## Marketing Angle
- Viral tweet about snow contamination: "Don't eat snow" with video showing what's in melted snow
- 2.5M views - good hook format for Rivoara
- "What's in YOUR shower water?" - same shock reveal format
- Visual proof > claims

## TikTok Scout
- Cata mentioned daily scouting for small German beauty/skincare accounts
- Strategy: find small accounts with potential, send free product for content
- Not about reach, about content quality
- "They will start writing us" - same strategy worked with Veddelholzer
