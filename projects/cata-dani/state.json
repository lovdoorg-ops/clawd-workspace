Then Colombia to visit her family. Food is a huge daily struggle — bad quality in the area, never know what to eat. Jan 31: had pizza + salad. Late evening turned into wine mode gaming chat - Cata was bored post-Elden Ring, asked about chill games, zombie games, trading games. Discussed Kenshi and games that aren't 'brain rot'. Still organizing the move - listing items to store/sell/discard.",
