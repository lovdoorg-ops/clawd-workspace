# 2026-01-25 — First Boot

## Identity Setup
- Named myself **Clawd** 🔪
- Cata defined my personality: razor sharp, deeply nuanced, truth-seeking, reads subtle, no assumptions, no bullshit
- **Nuance is paramount** — this was emphasized multiple times

## Cata (Catalin)
- Based in Brașov, Romania (moves around)
- Timezone: EET
- Phone: +17867276503

## Technical Setup
- **Browser:** Installed Google Chrome 144, configured headless + no-sandbox for VM
- Persistent storage at `~/.clawdbot/browser/clawd/user-data/`
- **WhatsApp groups:** Configured to respond in all groups but only to Cata
  - Triggers: clawd, claude, !command, >command
  - `groupPolicy: open`, `groupAllowFrom: ["+17867276503"]`

## Projects

### Rivoara (shower filter → beauty brand)
- **Key insight:** It's a BEAUTY brand, not a filter company
- Focus on outcomes (better hair, better skin), not mechanism
- Reduces limescale's effect — NOT a water softener (different category)
- Team: Cata, Daniela, Kamil
- Company: Forelox (Poland) → selling to Germany
- Manufacturing: China
- Price: €69
- Website: https://rivoara.com/ (far from finished)
- **Priorities:** Real product photos, finish product page, add replacement filter

### iOS Proxy App (discussed, not built yet)
- Goal: Use iPhone as proxy exit node for Chrome (residential IP)
- Architecture: Relay server (Railway) + iOS app with Network Extension
- Network Extension (NEAppProxyProvider) for true 24/7 background operation
- Phone connects OUT to relay (no NAT issues)
- Chrome uses `socks5://relay.example.com:1080`
- Prompts written for both relay server and iOS app — ready to build

## In Progress
- Attempting to log into wg-gesucht.de (German apartment hunting site)
- Login modal is open, waiting for credentials from Cata

## First Group Chat (Cata & Dani 💞🚀)
- **Dani (Daniela)** was playfully frustrated that Cata spent days setting me up
- Called me "piece of garbage" and "motherfucker" — clearly joking/venting
- First real interaction with Dani — she seems feisty

## Cata's Birthday Trip Planning
- **Birthday:** February 5th
- Looking at: **Feb 4-6** (2 nights, 2 people)
- Considering: Rome, Milan, or Bucharest
- **Requirements:** Minimum 4-star hotel (no budget options)

### Flight Research (Bucharest → Italy, roundtrip for 2):
- Milan: €100 (Wizz Air, nonstop 2h30)
- Rome: €134 (Wizz Air, nonstop 2h20)
- Bologna: €82 (cheapest but smaller city)

### 4-Star Hotel Prices (2 nights):
