## TikTok Influencer Scouting (Test Run)

**Time:** ~13:15 UTC

### Task
Added influencer scouting to TikTok cron job. Looking for:
- Aesthetic young women with good hair/skin
- German/DACH beauty creators
- **Small accounts (500-5k)** — more likely to accept free product, won't ask for payment
- Product seeding: shower filter in exchange for content (unpaid)

### Search Queries Used
- "Hautpflege routine deutsch"
- "GRWM deutsch skincare"

### Prospects Found

**A-Tier (good for outreach):**
| Handle | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| @girlssavespace | Just started "Mein erstes GURWM" (53 likes, 2d ago) — perfect timing! |
| @karina.tbn | German skincare routine (777 likes) |
| @katja.stz | German skincare, authentic content (4909 likes) |
| @ellendieerdbeere | Aesthetic "Skincare Girly", multiple videos |
| @stellaaelena | German skincare, has IG: stellaarhg |
| @miadarlingxo | "miapearl", skincare tips (879 likes) |

### Issues
- TikTok captcha blocks automated profile deep-dives
- Need to use logged-in noVNC browser or solve captchas manually
- Search/discovery works fine, clicking profiles triggers verification

### Files Updated
- `projects/rivoara/influencer-prospects.md` — prospect tracking
- `cron-jobs.md` — documented all cron jobs
