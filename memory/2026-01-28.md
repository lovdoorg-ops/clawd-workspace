## Cron System Overhaul

**Problem identified:** Cron jobs were firing (system events delivered) but I wasn't executing tasks when busy with conversations. Jobs showed `lastStatus: ok` but work wasn't done.

**Solution implemented:** Hybrid queue + spawn system
- Created `/root/clawd/cron-queue.json` for task tracking
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with mandatory queue check
- Updated 5 cron jobs to use new flow:
  - `wg-gesucht-inbox`
  - `instagram-veddelholzer-daily`
  - `tiktok-rivoara-warmup`
  - `wg-gesucht-search`
  - `tiktok-rivoara-trends`

**New flow:** Cron fires → add to queue → spawn sub-agent → sub-agent works → updates queue → heartbeat catches failures

Docs: `/root/clawd/docs/cron-queue-system.md`

## TikTok Research Clarification

Cata clarified: TikTok research must happen ON TikTok only. No Google searches, no web articles. Updated both TikTok cron jobs with explicit warning.
